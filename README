Hiram College 
Fall 2019

This project was written as my Independent Research Component II for Hiram College in Fall of 2019. The purpose of this project to reseach, understand,
and implement various functions of pluggable authentication modules, better known as PAM. This project was written for Ubuntu 16.04 and I am not sure
if it will run the same, if at all, on other operating systems. Below are the correct instructions for compiling the C programs in this project. I may 
create a MakeFile for this project in the future.

Compile test_pam -- gcc -o test_pam test_pam.c -lpam -lpam_misc
Compile italiano.c -- gcc -fPIC -fno-stack-protector -c italiano.c
Create Shared Object -- sudo ld -x --shared -o /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/italiano.so italiano.o

There are also some requirements the user should be aware of:
1. The usrf file must be located in the /etc directory.
2. Python3 is required to properly run verify.py.
3. This module must be implemented on Ubuntu 16.04 systems.
4. For testing purposes, the test_pam file must be located in the /etc/pam.d directory.
5. If test_pam.c is compiled to a different name, the test_pam file mentioned above must also be changed to match the name.
