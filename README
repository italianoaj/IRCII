Hiram College 
Fall 2019

This project was written as my Independent Research Component II for Hiram College in Fall of 2019. The purpose of this project to reseach, understand,and implement various functions of pluggable authentication modules, better known as PAM. This project was written for Ubuntu 16.04 and I am not sureif it will run the same, if at all, on other operating systems. Below are the correct instructions for compiling the C programs in this project.

Run the Makefile to properly compile the code(You will need sudo access). A tester program will also be present to test the PAM module before implementation into a live system. To remove the tester program, run "make clean"

There are also some requirements the user should be aware of:
1. The italiano_verify directory must be placed in the /etc directory.
2. Python3 is required to properly run verify.py.
3. This module must be implemented on Ubuntu 16.04 systems.
4. For testing purposes, the test_pam file must be located in the /etc/pam.d directory.
